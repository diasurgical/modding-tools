# Diablo 1 modding tools

This is a set of tools for modding Diablo 1, and more specificually DevilutionX.

## Map Making

For level editing we build on top of [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/), a versatile tile-based level editor with many features that can greatly speed up the process of making a level. Please see the [mapping section](Tiled/README.md) for how to set it up, and use it effectively.
